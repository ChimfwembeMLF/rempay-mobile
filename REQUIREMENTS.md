# Feature Specification: Mobile App Requirements

**Feature Branch**: `001-mobile-app-requirements`  
**Created**: February 6, 2026  
**Status**: Draft  

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Monitor account health (Priority: P1)

As a merchant operator, I want a clear mobile view of balances, recent transactions, and payout status so I can quickly understand the business’s financial position without logging into a desktop system.

**Why this priority**: This is the minimum valuable outcome; users must see their financial status to make decisions and trust the system.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and verifying that the dashboard, balances, and recent activity are visible and accurate for a single account.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with access to one merchant account, **When** they open the app, **Then** they see current available balance, pending balance, and the last 10 transactions.
2. **Given** multiple merchant accounts, **When** the user selects a specific account, **Then** the dashboard updates to that account’s balances and activity.

---

### User Story 2 - Request and track disbursements (Priority: P2)

As an authorized operator, I want to submit a payout request and track its approval and settlement status so I can move funds to the correct destination when needed.

**Why this priority**: Payouts are a core operational task that drives cash flow and reduces reliance on manual processes.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a payout request, seeing it in the list, and observing status changes on a test account.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** sufficient available balance, **When** a user submits a disbursement request, **Then** the request is recorded with a unique reference and initial status.
2. **Given** a submitted disbursement, **When** its status changes (e.g., approved, rejected, settled), **Then** the user can see the updated status and timestamp.

---

### User Story 3 - Receive critical alerts (Priority: P3)

As a merchant administrator, I want real-time alerts for failed transactions, chargebacks, or disbursement issues so I can respond quickly and minimize business impact.

**Why this priority**: Alerts reduce operational risk and improve response time, but are less critical than viewing balances and managing payouts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering an alert and confirming it appears in-app and in the notification inbox.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a failed transaction event, **When** the event occurs, **Then** an alert is generated and visible to the user.
2. **Given** multiple alerts, **When** the user opens an alert, **Then** they can view the event details and mark it as read.

---

### Edge Cases

- User loses connectivity while viewing balances or submitting a disbursement.
- A user with limited permissions attempts to access restricted financial actions.
- The same disbursement request is submitted twice from different devices.
- A large transaction list exceeds typical mobile pagination limits.
- Alerts arrive for an account the user no longer has access to.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authorized users to sign in and access only the merchant accounts they are assigned to.
- **FR-002**: System MUST present a mobile dashboard showing available balance, pending balance, and recent transactions for the selected account.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to filter and search transactions by date range, status, and amount range.
- **FR-004**: System MUST display transaction details, including reference, amount, status, timestamp, and counterparty metadata.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow authorized users to submit disbursement requests with amount, destination, and purpose.
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent disbursement submission when available balance is insufficient or destination details are invalid.
- **FR-007**: System MUST show disbursement status history and timestamps for each request.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide an alerts inbox with status, severity, and event details for operational events.
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to acknowledge and mark alerts as read.
- **FR-010**: System MUST support multiple user roles with distinct permissions (e.g., viewer, operator, administrator).
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain an activity log visible to administrators for key actions performed in the app.
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to manage their profile and notification preferences.
- **FR-013**: System MUST support secure session timeout and re-authentication for sensitive actions.
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide clear error messages and recovery options for failed actions.
- **FR-015**: System MUST localize date, time, and currency display to the user’s locale settings.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Person who signs in to the app; includes role, contact details, and assigned merchant accounts.
- **Merchant Account**: The business entity whose balances, transactions, and disbursements are managed.
- **Balance**: Available and pending funds for a merchant account at a point in time.
- **Transaction**: A payment event with amount, status, timestamps, and references.
- **Disbursement**: A payout request with amount, destination, status history, and audit metadata.
- **Alert**: An operational notification tied to an event and its severity.
- **Activity Log**: Record of user actions for accountability and review.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Assumptions

- The mobile app is intended for merchant staff (operators and administrators) rather than end customers.
- Users already have pre-provisioned accounts and permissions managed outside the mobile app.
- Disbursement approvals, if required, are performed by users with elevated permissions within the app.

### Dependencies

- Access to authoritative merchant account, balance, transaction, and disbursement data.
- Availability of alert events for failed transactions and disbursement issues.
- Established role and permission assignments for users.

### Out of Scope

- End-customer payment experiences (checkout or wallet features).
- Creation of new merchant accounts or onboarding flows.
- Dispute or chargeback resolution workflows beyond alert viewing.

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of users can find current balance and last 10 transactions within 30 seconds of opening the app.
- **SC-002**: 90% of disbursement requests are submitted successfully on the first attempt without support assistance.
- **SC-003**: 95% of operational alerts are viewed by at least one authorized user within 10 minutes of issuance.
- **SC-004**: User-reported confusion about transaction status decreases by 40% within two months of release.
